IT Strategy & Modernization

1. Current Challenges
Multiple groups use apps that do the same thing in different, unlinked ways.
Heavy reliance on spreadsheets; systems are unorganized and fragmented.
Lack of adoption training across platforms.
Data remains siloed; BI team has current data but not full visibility.
3–5 business-critical custom apps are dated.
CareGuide is still in use as a legacy application.
Centralized EHR strategy unclear; multiple platforms in play (Homecare Homebase, PointClickCare, Athena, Epic mentioned).
Significant analysis required over the next few years to consolidate and modernize.
2. Opportunities with AI & Technology
Simplify and standardize the application landscape.
Consolidate overlapping apps and workflows.
Automate and streamline data migration and governance.
Move intranet from Mango Apps to SharePoint.
Complete remaining file share migrations to SharePoint.
Stand up Microsoft Maverick for data migration, connected into Microsoft Elevate and BDO.
Store all organizational data in Microsoft Fabric’s OneLake.
Govern and secure data with Microsoft Purview (classification, monitoring, access control).
Explore AI-driven efficiencies (e.g., Athena POC for AI dictation and summarization).
Position Future Secure AI as a foundation for trustworthy, compliant systems.
3. Strategic Goals
Establish a central EHR system to unify healthcare data.
Enable outcome-driven reporting through BI team with full access to OneLake data.
Standardize processes and workflows across the organization.
Build internal IT capability after years of outsourcing.
Modernize legacy applications and reduce duplication.
Ensure governance, security, and compliance across all systems.
