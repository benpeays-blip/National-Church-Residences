IT Strategy & Modernization

1. Current Challenges
Application Overlap & Silos
Multiple groups use apps that do the same thing in different, unlinked ways.
Heavy reliance on spreadsheets; systems are unorganized and fragmented.
Lack of adoption training across platforms.
Data & Reporting Gaps
BI team (reporting to Jake Swint and Justin Gonzalez) has current data but not full visibility.
Data remains siloed across Yardi, Workday, and custom apps.
Legacy Systems
3–5 business-critical custom apps are dated.
CareGuide is a legacy application still in use.
Centralized EHR strategy is unclear; multiple platforms (Homecare Homebase, PointClickCare, Athena, Epic mentioned).
Analysis Needs
Significant analysis required over the next few years to consolidate and modernize.
2. Tech Stack
Core Systems
Workday (long-term platform for HR, messaging, lifestyle management).
Yardi (property management, accounting, HUD/LIHTC compliance, resident management).
MFiles (document management).
Mango Apps (current intranet, messaging, collaboration).
Blueworks (process mapping, workflow documentation, automation prep).
Copilot (AI productivity assistant).
Future Secure AI (AI systems built with security, privacy, governance, reliability, trustworthiness).
Healthcare Systems
HomeCare – Medical Services.
HomeBase – Medical Services.
CareGuide – Legacy application.
Epic (mentioned as potential).
Athena (POC with AI dictation tools for clinic technicians).
Hardware
Surface Pros (recent upgrade; standardized devices for staff).
3. Strategic Wants & Initiatives
Data & Governance
Stand up Microsoft Maverick for data migration.
Connect into Microsoft Elevate and BDO.
Store all organizational data in Microsoft Fabric’s OneLake.
Govern and secure data with Microsoft Purview (classification, monitoring, access control).
Consolidation & Standardization
Simplify and standardize the application landscape.
Consolidation of overlapping apps and workflows.
Move intranet from Mango Apps to SharePoint.
Complete remaining file share migrations to SharePoint.
EHR Strategy
Move toward a central EHR system (currently fragmented across Homecare Homebase, PointClickCare, Athena, Epic).
Innovation & AI
POC with Athena for AI dictation (note-taking and summarization for clinic technicians).
Explore AI-driven efficiencies while maintaining security and compliance.
4. Organizational Context
Previously outsourced IT to MSP until 18 months ago; now building internal capability.
Working on POC with asset management team.
Emily maintains master list of applications.
NCR acquired At Your Door Visiting Healthcare Services, expanding healthcare footprint.
5. Impact Potential
Operational Efficiency: Reduced duplication, streamlined workflows, standardized platforms.
Data Visibility: Unified reporting through BI team with full access to OneLake data.
Governance & Security: Compliance and trust reinforced through Purview and Future Secure AI.
Healthcare Outcomes: Centralized EHR and AI tools improve care delivery and documentation.
Scalability: Modernized tech stack supports NCR’s growth in housing and healthcare.
