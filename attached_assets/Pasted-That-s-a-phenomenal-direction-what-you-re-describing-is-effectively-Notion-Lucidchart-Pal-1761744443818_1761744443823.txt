That’s a *phenomenal* direction — what you’re describing is effectively **“Notion + Lucidchart + Palantir Foundry for fundraising ops”** — a visual, ontology-driven workflow builder that lets you model *how fundraising actually flows* across tools, people, and data.

Let’s do both parts methodically:

1. Define **industry-standard workflow templates** (ready to load + edit).
2. Define the full **artifact/block taxonomy** (the “Lego set” of all pieces).

---

## **Part 1: Standard Fundraising Workflow Templates**

These are real-world, reusable flows that capture what 80 % of professional development shops already do.
Each template = sequence of artifacts (tools → people → data → reports → actions).

| **Template Name**                          | **Purpose / Description**                                                | **Key Blocks**                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Major Gift Pipeline**                 | Manages prospects from identification → cultivation → ask → stewardship. | CRM → Wealth Screen → Gift Officer Task → Meeting Note → Gift Record → Thank-You → Report to Director |
| **2. New Donor Welcome Journey**           | Automates first-time donor experience.                                   | Donation Form → Email Automation → CRM Update → Thank Task → Follow-Up Sequence → Retention Report    |
| **3. Lapsed Donor Reactivation**           | Re-engages LYBUNT/SYBUNT donors.                                         | CRM Segment → Email Campaign → Call Task → Gift Response → Update Donor Stage                         |
| **4. Grant Application Pipeline**          | Tracks LOIs, proposals, awards, and reporting.                           | Grant Database → Program Manager → Budget Doc → Submission → Decision → Grant Report → Finance Update |
| **5. Event Fundraising Flow**              | Runs gala or campaign event end-to-end.                                  | Event Platform → Invitation Email → Registration → Check-In → Donation → CRM Sync → Follow-Up         |
| **6. Digital Campaign (Email + Social)**   | Drives recurring and one-time gifts online.                              | Marketing Platform → Landing Page → Payment Gateway → CRM Gift → Reporting Dashboard                  |
| **7. Monthly Donor Program**               | Subscription-style giving management.                                    | Payment Processor → CRM Recurring Gift → Email Renewal → MRR Report → Finance Reconcile               |
| **8. Corporate Matching Gifts**            | Captures and records employer matches.                                   | Donation → Double the Donation Lookup → Match Submission → CRM Update → Acknowledgment                |
| **9. Data Hygiene & Dedupe Cycle**         | Cleans donor data routinely.                                             | Import → Validation → Dedupe → Human Review → Merged Record → Sync Back to CRM                        |
| **10. Prospect Research Cycle**            | Identifies new high-capacity donors.                                     | CRM Export → WealthEngine/iWave → Researcher Review → Portfolio Assign → Gift Officer Follow-Up       |
| **11. Board Reporting & KPIs**             | Produces executive/board dashboards.                                     | CRM → Finance → Analytics → Report Doc → Distribution to Board                                        |
| **12. Campaign Planning & Forecasting**    | Combines goal setting with predictive analytics.                         | CRM Data → BI Tool → Forecast Model → Review Meeting → Action Plan                                    |
| **13. Volunteer Recruitment & Engagement** | For event volunteers or peer fundraisers.                                | Volunteer Portal → Approval → Communication → Assignment → Post-Event Report                          |
| **14. Donor Survey & Feedback Loop**       | Collects and acts on donor sentiment.                                    | Survey Tool → Data Capture → CRM Update → Sentiment Dashboard → Follow-Up                             |
| **15. Stewardship Communications Cycle**   | Keeps major donors informed post-gift.                                   | Gift Record → Story Content → Email Update → Meeting → Next Opportunity                               |

These become the **Workflow Library** inside your app — a user can clone one, drag blocks, and swap in their own tools or agents.

## **Part 2: Artifact / Block Taxonomy**

Think of this as your **ontology of work** — the canonical building blocks of a fundraising workflow.
Each artifact has:

* **Type** (category)
* **Sub-type** (specific vendor or function)
* **I/O schema** (what data it consumes/produces)

## **How It All Fits Together**

* **Artifacts = Blocks** you drag on a **Workflow Canvas.**
* **Connections** (arrows) = data or task flow.
* Each block knows its **I/O schema** and **vendor bindings** (e.g., “CRM.People” → “iWave.CapacityScore”).
* You can save workflows as **Templates** in a shared **Library** (e.g., “Major Gift Pipeline,” “Grant Cycle”).
* Future: add **execution mode** — agents actually run the workflow (pull data, trigger emails, update CRM).

---

## **Part 3: User-Facing Experience Concept**

1. **Canvas View:** drag-and-drop nodes (Systems, Humans, Data, Actions).
2. **Left Panel:** block palette organized by the taxonomy above.
3. **Right Panel:** properties/config (API bindings, fields, owners, triggers).
4. **Top Bar:** save → template, publish → library, simulate → run.
5. **Library Tab:** curated templates (from Part 1).
6. **Execution View:** shows runtime progress, agent logs, data snapshots.

---

## **Next Step**

I can now:

* generate a **JSON schema + seed data** for all block types (for the builder’s palette), and
* design **three pre-populated templates** (Major Gift Pipeline, New Donor Welcome Journey, Grant Cycle) ready to render on a canvas.

Would you like me to draft that schema + example templates next so you can load them directly into your Replit or Cursor project?
