1. Current Challenges
Organizational Fragmentation
NCR grew with a siloed mentality across Affordable Housing, Senior Housing, Senior Living (16 communities), Senior Services (value-based care), Real Estate Development, and Foundations.
Systems are antiquated; unclear how to migrate data onto modern platforms.
Data does not flow across the company as it should, limiting visibility and efficiency.
Culture is struggling to keep pace with rapid change; leadership may need to slow down transformation.
Data & Monetization Gaps
Large volumes of patient and resident data exist but have not been monetized.
No clear governance process; data security and compliance are not yet standardized.
Must pass Medicaid and Medicare audits by June, requiring stronger governance.
CareGuide Update Needed
Legacy CareGuide system requires modernization and integration into the broader tech stack.
2. Current Tech Stack
Microsoft Elevate – Strategic relationship to update tech stack and gain access to foundation funding.
Azure & Microsoft Fabric – Migration underway to enable unified data storage and governance.
Power BI – New partner for advanced analytics and reporting; expected to provide unprecedented data access.
Yardi – Affordable housing platform; should be leveraged as a competitive advantage.
GraceWorks – Planning to sell NCR 700 systems, adding complexity to integration.
3. Desired Capabilities (“Wants”)
Competitive Tech Stack
Build a technology infrastructure that provides NCR with a competitive advantage in housing, healthcare, and services.
Overlay tech stack across affordable housing facilities (50 managed properties) and senior living communities.
Data Governance & Flow
Launching a data governance project to understand and standardize how data flows through the organization.
Secure data, develop governance processes, and ensure compliance with audits.
Value-Based Care Integration
Roll up value-based care programs and share savings with third-party partners.
Use services to acquire patients while delivering care, aligning with Medicare’s shared savings model.
Strategic Growth & Alignment
Align divisions under a three-year roadmap toward consolidation.
Position NCR as a thought leader in affordable housing, senior living, and value-based care.
Explore acquisition strategies in HUD spaces despite nonprofit constraints.
4. Notes & Strategic Context
Member of the Vision Task Force guiding sales/marketing, public policy, M&A strategy, and technology.
Leadership roles:
Matt builds
Sonya Brown runs affordable housing
Adam overlays the tech stack across divisions
NCR grew up as a real estate company, now expanded into housing, healthcare, and services.
Technology adoption (Azure, Fabric, Power BI) is central to future growth.
Current state of change makes adoption of advanced platforms like Futuria premature.
5. Summary Insight
Adam’s perspective highlights deep fragmentation, antiquated systems, and unmonetized data as core barriers to growth. NCR is in a fluid adjustment period where culture and infrastructure cannot keep pace with strategic ambitions.
The desired future state requires:
A competitive tech stack that unifies housing, healthcare, services, and development
Strong data governance to secure information, pass audits, and enable monetization
Integration of value-based care with shared savings models
Consolidation roadmap to align divisions under one enterprise vision
Strategic partnerships (Microsoft Elevate, GraceWorks, Power BI) leveraged to accelerate transformation
Adam’s role is to overlay technology as a growth enabler, positioning NCR as a thought leader in affordable housing, senior living, and value-based care while building a sustainable competitive advantage.
