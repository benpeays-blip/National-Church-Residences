A. ACQUAINTANCE → PARTNER
Primary Goal: Move from transactional giving to relational awareness and structured next steps.
Strategy

Acknowledge their gift personally.
Humanize the relationship. Acquaintances become friends when they feel seen.

Invite them into light-touch structure.
Examples:

short update email with a personal note,

quick “behind the scenes” story,

low-commitment survey (“Which part of our mission matters most to you?”).

Place them in a predictable cadence.

Quarterly impact summaries

Personalized content based on interest

Offer a micro-commitment.

RSVP for a 15-minute virtual update

Join a small group tour

Attend an info session

Identify affinity signals.
Once they show interest, move them to “Friend.”

Bridge to higher-touch conversation.

“I noticed your interest in ___. Could we share a short update with you?”

Outcome

They become Friends, then Colleagues, then Partners.

B. FRIEND → PARTNER
Primary Goal: Add structure to high-energy relational warmth.
Strategy

Convert relational warmth into a plan.

“You’ve been close to our story — I’d love to explore what meaningful partnership might look like.”

Introduce cadence.

Calendar the next touchpoint before ending the current one.

Move from spontaneous connection → predictable engagement.

Give them a role or responsibility.
Friends become partners when they feel needed, not just liked:

host a small gathering,

join a vision preview,

help shape a project.

Present specific investment opportunities.

Friends respond to emotion; partners respond to clarity.

Give them something concrete to own.

Create a vision conversation.

Invite them into the “why now” and the long-term plan.

Connect their passion to a strategic initiative.

Outcome

Friendship + structure becomes Partnership.

C. COLLEAGUE → PARTNER
Primary Goal: Warm the relationship and deepen energy without removing structure.
Strategy

Move from impersonal to personal.

Send a personalized update tied to their giving history.

Invite them to a short thank-you call.

Show them the meaning behind the structure.

“Your automated monthly gift has helped…”

Give emotional significance to their pattern.

Offer deeper insight and stories.

Video updates

Program leader testimonials

Real-life transformation stories

Personal invitation to a higher-value opportunity.
Colleagues respond to system integrity, so show how a major gift fits the broader structure:

multi-year vision

strategic initiative

campaign involvement

Bridge them to relational connection.

Introduce them to a key leader.

Invite them to smaller gatherings where partnership feels natural.

Outcome

Colleague → relational warmth → structured major gift pathway → Partner.
