Below is a clear, **non-marketing**, practical explanation of what **Relationship Science (RelSci)** and **Dun & Bradstreet (D&B)** actually do, how they work, and how they would realistically be used by **NCR / NCR Foundation** for research and fundraising.

---

## 1. Relationship Science (RelSci)

### What it is (plain English)

RelSci is a **relationship-mapping platform**.
It shows **who knows whom**, how they’re connected, and where influence flows.

Think of it as:

* “LinkedIn + boardrooms + family ties + philanthropic circles”
* Built specifically for **fundraising, major gifts, and institutional relationships**

---

### What data RelSci uses

RelSci aggregates and curates:

* Corporate board memberships
* Executive leadership roles
* Nonprofit boards & trustees
* Family relationships (when public)
* Educational overlap
* Shared philanthropy
* Prior employment overlap
* Advisory roles

It **does not** scrape private data — it relies on:

* SEC filings
* IRS Form 990s
* Annual reports
* Press releases
* Public bios
* Reputable databases

---

### What RelSci actually does for NCR

#### A. Relationship Mapping

You can:

* Enter a **prospect name**
* Enter a **foundation**
* Enter a **corporation**
* Enter a **board member**

And see:

* Who they are connected to
* Whether someone in NCR’s orbit already knows them
* How many “degrees” of separation exist

Example:

* NCR board member → sits on board with → CEO of regional bank → also trustee at foundation → potential major donor

---

#### B. Warm-Path Discovery

Instead of cold outreach, RelSci answers:

* “Who can open the door?”
* “Who should make the introduction?”
* “Who already has relational capital?”

This is **huge** for:

* Major gifts
* Foundation cultivation
* Corporate partnerships

---

### Typical NCR Use Cases

* Major donor research
* Foundation strategy
* Board engagement
* Event invitation prioritization
* Capital campaign preparation

---

### Strengths

* Best-in-class for **relationship intelligence**
* Very strong for **high-net-worth and institutional donors**
* Excellent for **board-driven fundraising cultures**

---

### Limitations

* Not a financial database
* Not a CRM
* Not good for small donors
* Requires disciplined usage to justify cost

---

## 2. Dun & Bradstreet (D&B)

### What it is (plain English)

D&B is a **business intelligence and corporate financial database**.

It answers:

* “Is this company financially healthy?”
* “Who owns it?”
* “What subsidiaries exist?”
* “What’s their revenue scale?”
* “Are they stable?”

---

### What data D&B uses

* Self-reported company filings
* Trade payment data
* Credit activity
* Government records
* Corporate disclosures

Every company has a **D-U-N-S number** (unique identifier).

---

### What D&B actually does for NCR

#### A. Corporate Prospecting

You can research:

* Corporate donors
* Employers of donors
* Potential sponsors
* Corporate foundations
* Regional business strength

You’ll see:

* Estimated revenue
* Number of employees
* Growth trend
* Ownership structure
* Parent / subsidiary relationships

---

#### B. Risk & Capacity Assessment

D&B helps answer:

* “Is this company strong enough to give?”
* “Is this a long-term partner?”
* “Is this business declining or growing?”

This matters for:

* Sponsorship asks
* Multi-year commitments
* Naming opportunities
* Vendor-partner relationships

---

### Typical NCR Use Cases

* Corporate giving research
* Sponsor vetting
* Foundation due diligence
* Employer-matching gift strategy
* Regional market analysis

---

### Strengths

* Gold standard for **corporate data**
* Very strong for **mid-to-large businesses**
* Useful beyond fundraising (finance, partnerships)

---

### Limitations

* Weak on personal relationships
* Less useful for individual donors
* Data can lag for small or private firms

---

## 3. How RelSci + D&B Work Together (Important)

Used together, they cover **two different intelligence layers**:

| Layer                              | Tool                 |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Who knows whom?**                | Relationship Science |
| **Can this organization give?**    | Dun & Bradstreet     |
| **Board & influence paths**        | RelSci               |
| **Corporate capacity & stability** | D&B                  |
| **Warm introductions**             | RelSci               |
| **Financial vetting**              | D&B                  |

### Example Workflow

1. Use **D&B** to identify:

   * Top employers in NCR regions
   * Strong, growing companies
2. Use **RelSci** to:

   * Map NCR board connections to executives at those firms
   * Identify warm intro paths
3. Move prospects into CRM (Raiser’s Edge)
4. Assign cultivation strategy

---

## 4. How This Fits NCR’s Existing Stack

Since NCR is already using:

* **Raiser’s Edge NXT** (CRM)
* **WealthEngine** (individual wealth)

Then:

* **RelSci** fills the **relationship gap**
* **D&B** fills the **corporate intelligence gap**

They do **not replace** existing tools — they **augment** them.

---

## 5. Practical Subscription Reality

### Relationship Science

* Enterprise pricing
* Typically licensed per user
* Best for:

  * Major gifts officers
  * Foundation relations
  * Executive leadership
* Needs:

  * Clear use cases
  * Regular training
  * Defined research workflows

### Dun & Bradstreet

* Tiered subscriptions
* Often modular
* Can be used by:

  * Development
  * Finance
  * Partnerships
* Easier to justify across departments

---

## 6. Bottom-Line Recommendation for NCR

**If NCR is serious about:**

* Major gifts
* Institutional funding
* Board-driven fundraising
* Corporate partnerships

Then:

* **RelSci = strategic advantage**
* **D&B = strong operational intelligence**

But the real value comes when:

* There is **process discipline**
* Research feeds directly into **action**
* Board members are engaged using the insights

---

If you want, next I can:

* Map this to **specific NCR fundraising scenarios**
* Help decide **how many seats** make sense
* Compare RelSci vs alternatives (PitchBook, BoardEx, iWave, etc.)
* Design a **research → action workflow** so this doesn’t become shelfware
