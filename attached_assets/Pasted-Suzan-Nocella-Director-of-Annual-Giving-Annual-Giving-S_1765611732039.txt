Annual Giving Strategy
1. Current Challenges
Information Access & Reliance
Must rely on sales and marketing team for resident information, which may be incomplete.
Information often stored in her head instead of Raiser’s Edge due to system inefficiency.
Board members and leadership lack clarity on messaging and processes.
Campaign & Communication Limitations
No infrastructure to build campaigns; limited time for research and development.
Writing donor communications takes significant time; AI could help refine.
No unified message across the organization; inconsistent language and presentation.
Leadership communication often bypasses legal review, creating risk.
Donor Engagement Gaps
No acquisition strategy for fundraising; no new prospecting.
Current fundraising relies only on resident donors giving to their own communities.
Leads from prospective donors/residents are not captured or assigned.
Time is disproportionately spent on low-value donors instead of targeted high-net-worth prospects.
Organizational Inefficiency
Mapping of onramps and touchpoints is unclear; requests bounce between leaders before reaching her.
Leadership lacks education on proper communication channels and ownership.
Processes are overly complex, leading to delays and miscommunication.
2. Current Tools & Constraints
WealthEngine – Not found helpful; not embraced or utilized.
Raiser’s Edge – Used for donor management but cumbersome and underutilized.
iWave – Donor-prospecting and wealth-screening platform; potential tool for identifying major-gift prospects.
3. Desired Capabilities (“Wants”)
Donor Intelligence & Funnel Development
Funnel for “getting to know donors” section.
AI-assisted donor insights without intrusiveness or confidentiality risks.
Voice memo tool to capture donor notes directly into database for easy retrieval.
Campaign & Communication Support
AI to refine and generate holiday appeals, campaigns, and year-round communications.
Unified messaging across the organization—consistent language and presentation.
Clear company lines for presenting NCR externally.
Strategic Planning
Strategic plan for each community.
Mapping exercise to define organizational touchpoints and communication pathways.
Education for leadership to simplify processes and reduce misrouting of information.
Fundraising Growth
Acquisition strategy for new donors and prospects.
Redeployment of staff to focus on targeted, high-value donor funnels.
Shift away from reliance solely on resident donors.
4. Donor Groups
General Population Donors – Unknown, unstructured, no acquisition strategy.
Resident Donors – High-net-worth individuals in senior living communities.
Growing Base – More individuals moving into communities, creating potential donor pool.
5. Additional Observations
Suzan has been with the foundation team for 14–15 years.
She has never directly asked for a gift, though residents trust her to execute fundraising.
Current fundraising success is tied only to residents giving to their own communities.
Significant untapped potential exists in prospecting and acquisition strategies.
6. Summary Insight
Suzan’s perspective highlights gaps in donor acquisition, campaign infrastructure, and unified messaging. Current fundraising relies too heavily on resident donors, with no strategy for new prospects.
The desired future state requires:
AI-driven donor intelligence and communication support
A unified organizational message and streamlined communication pathways
Strategic plans for each community
A clear acquisition strategy to grow beyond resident donors
Redeployment of staff toward targeted, high-value donor funnels
This would transform annual giving from reactive, resident-based fundraising into a strategic, scalable donor engagement program.
