1. AI-Powered Prospect Discovery & Prioritization

Goals:

Analyze 5,000+ active donors plus external data (wealth indicators, philanthropy records, etc.).

Rank high-potential individuals, foundations, and corporations by giving capacity, engagement history, and program affinity.

Maintain live-updating prospect profiles for continuous refinement.

Current Pain Points:

Manual research consumes hours per prospect.

Wealth screening data quickly becomes outdated.

“Hidden” wealthy donors remain undiscovered in the database.

Capacity ratings are too broad or inaccurate.

Hard to predict who will give versus who merely can give.

External data sources are siloed and expensive.

Current Tech Stack / Operational Process:

Donor data stored in Raiser’s Edge and Excel-based lists.

Wealth screening done periodically through iWave or DonorSearch, refreshed manually.

Staff manually review donor notes and past giving to build shortlists.

Limited integration between CRM and external databases; reports exported manually for analysis.

No live donor scoring or automated enrichment process in place.

Solution:

Integrate CRM and accounting systems with external data (WealthEngine, IRS 990s, LinkedIn, real estate, and philanthropy indexes).

Deploy AI-driven scoring to predict propensity to give using engagement history, event participation, and wealth signals.

Automate data refreshes and enrichment for continuous accuracy.

Create real-time dashboards highlighting the top 10% of prospects by readiness to give and affinity.

Result:

Prospect research time cut by 60%.

Increased accuracy in identifying active, high-probability donors.

Dynamic prospect ranking system continuously learning and improving.

Fundraisers focus their time where it has the highest impact.

2. Advanced Relationship Mapping & Network Intelligence

Goals:

Deploy an AI-driven platform that goes beyond tools like Relationship Science.

Identify hidden connections, referral paths, and influence networks.

Strengthen collaboration with thought leaders, board members, and aligned partners.

Current Pain Points:

Relationship Science is costly ($25K–50K/year) and underutilized.

Board members rarely share their full networks.

LinkedIn data lacks context and integration.

“Warm paths” to major prospects remain hidden.

Event, volunteer, and corporate relationships aren’t linked in the CRM.

Corporate partnership opportunities are often missed.

Current Tech Stack / Operational Process:

Relationships tracked manually via spreadsheets and board member updates.

LinkedIn used informally but not connected to CRM.

Relationship Science data (if used) sits outside daily operations.

Event systems (like Eventbrite or Excel guest lists) are disconnected from donor profiles.

No central visualization of organizational relationships or shared affiliations.

Solution:

Implement a relationship intelligence layer using graph-based AI (e.g., Neo4j, Affinity, or Foundry Ontology).

Ingest CRM, event, and volunteer data to map shared affiliations and connections.

Enrich records with public network data to surface influence chains and warm introductions.

Generate visual “relationship maps” and suggest key introducers for each major donor.

Result:

Clear visualization of the Foundation’s donor ecosystem.

25–35% increase in warm introductions and board-driven leads.

Strengthened corporate and foundation partnerships through connection intelligence.

Board engagement deepens as members see the tangible value of their networks.

3. Data-Driven Pipeline Management & Segmentation

Goals:

Automate segmentation for individuals, foundations, and corporations.

Use AI to generate and prioritize donor pipelines based on giving potential and strategic fit.

Tailor engagement strategies dynamically by donor type.

Current Pain Points:

Static donor segments that don’t reflect current engagement.

Move management handled inconsistently across gift officers.

No way to predict when donors are “ready” to give.

Corporate/foundation giving tracked separately from individuals.

Officers spend time on low-probability donors.

No system for early detection of lapsed donors.

Current Tech Stack / Operational Process:

Donor portfolios assigned manually; progress tracked via Excel or static CRM reports.

Move management notes entered inconsistently across gift officers.

Corporate and foundation records often stored in different databases or modules.

No automated alerts when engagement declines or new signals arise.

Reporting consolidated manually by development staff at quarter-end.

Solution:

Centralize all donor types into a unified pipeline view using AI-assisted CRM integration.

Deploy predictive scoring that updates weekly based on donor activity, giving trends, and engagement signals.

Automate alerts for lapsed or reactivated donors.

Standardize move management workflows across the team with AI-driven prioritization.

Result:

30–40% increase in gift officer efficiency.

Consistent donor follow-up across the organization.

Real-time insight into which donors are trending up or at risk.

Predictive, living donor pipelines that adapt to behavior and timing.

4. AI-Enhanced Grant Proposal Crafting

Goals:

Use AI to automate proposal drafting aligned with funder priorities.

Integrate workflow tracking for submissions, deadlines, and reporting.

Improve proposal quality and efficiency organization-wide.

Current Pain Points:

Each proposal written manually from scratch.

Hard to tailor for each funder without starting over.

Program staff aren’t natural writers; quality varies.

Internal reviews delay submission timelines.

No centralized tracking of which proposals succeed or fail.

Reporting consumes substantial administrative time.

Current Tech Stack / Operational Process:

Proposal development tracked through Word docs and shared drives.

Deadlines managed through Outlook calendars or Excel sheets.

Reporting templates recreated for each funder.

Narrative content manually copied between proposals and reports.

No AI or automation supporting drafting or compliance tracking.

Solution:

Introduce an AI grant-writing assistant trained on previous proposals and funder guidelines.

Auto-generate first drafts, budgets, and measurable outcomes.

Embed workflow automation with reminders and task tracking for deadlines.

Implement feedback loops that identify language patterns correlated with wins.

Result:

70–80% reduction in proposal creation time.

Higher success rate through tailored, data-aligned narratives.

Centralized visibility on grant cycles, deadlines, and success metrics.

Staff focus shifts from writing to strategic relationship development.

5. Smart Event Planning & Donor Engagement

Goals:

Apply AI to identify top invitees for fundraising and stewardship events.

Predict donor engagement to personalize outreach and maximize attendance.

Strengthen post-event relationships through targeted follow-up.

Current Pain Points:

The same donors are invited repeatedly, missing new opportunities.

Attendance can’t be reliably predicted.

Post-event follow-up is inconsistent or forgotten.

ROI measured only by attendance numbers.

Seating and grouping don’t strategically connect donors.

Corporate sponsors often paired with mismatched events.

Current Tech Stack / Operational Process:

Event planning done via Eventbrite or manual guest lists.

Donor CRM not integrated with event attendance or engagement data.

RSVP and follow-up tracked via email chains or spreadsheets.

Post-event metrics limited to headcount, not gift impact.

No automated donor segmentation or recommendation system for events.

Solution:

Implement predictive analytics to select invitees most likely to attend and engage.

Personalize invitations and follow-up emails using donor insights and giving history.

Automate post-event reporting and ROI measurement (engagement scores, giving lift).

Use AI to design seating arrangements that optimize networking and connection-building.

Result:

Higher attendance and post-event conversion.

2x ROI on event outcomes compared to prior years.

Corporate sponsors better aligned with mission-appropriate events.

More personalized, meaningful donor experiences that strengthen long-term loyalty.
