Legal & Governance Strategy
1. Current Challenges
System Fragmentation
Numerous homegrown systems across the organization that do not communicate with one another.
No unified data pool; information lives in silos with no shared visibility.
Current fragmentation creates operational friction despite Mark Miller’s multi-year integration plan.
Manual, Inefficient Workflows
Gift processing is manual with no automation.
Thank-you letters are manually generated and physically mailed.
Volunteer event coordination is manual (e.g., SignUpGenius pages).
Signup workflows are not standardized or integrated with internal databases.
Information Hoarding
Employees hold onto information due to protectiveness or uncertainty about data use.
This obstructs cross-team collaboration and prevents a unified understanding of partners, donors, and activities.
Regulatory & Structural Complexity
Over 1,100 legal entities require tracking and coordination.
Heavy compliance restrictions (HIPAA, substance-use protections) limit data sharing.
Peer organizations achieve higher collaboration and transparency despite similar constraints.
Data Governance Concerns
Uncertainty about which AI tools are approved and how they should be used.
Lack of clarity on what data can be uploaded into AI systems.
Inconsistent processes for human oversight of AI-generated outputs.
Risks from informal use of unvetted IT tools across teams.
2. Current Tools & Constraints
Homegrown Database – Outdated; modernization is on Mark Miller’s roadmap.
PointClickCare – EHR system for senior living, skilled nursing, assisted living, and home health.
AthenaHealth – Used for palliative care.
SignUpGenius – Used manually for volunteer events and coordination.
Various Homegrown Systems – Custom-built, fragmented, disconnected.
IT & Data Strategy – Mark Miller leading “data link project” and 3–4 year systems alignment plan.
Geographic Structure – Healthcare only in Ohio; affordable housing across 22 states.
Authorized AI Tool – Microsoft Copilot is the only approved AI.
3. Desired Capabilities (“Wants”)
System Integration & Unified Data
Connected environment where clinical, housing, volunteer, donor, and legal systems talk to each other.
Centralized database for corporate entities (1,100+), legal documentation, and project tracking.
Unified data pool across business lines while respecting HIPAA and privacy constraints.
Automation of Manual Processes
Automated thank-you letters generated by AI (Copilot), tailored to gifts, mailed or emailed automatically.
Automated volunteer-event workflows: sign-up creation, participation tracking, and integration with organizational systems.
Improved Information Access & Collaboration
Systems that clarify how data is used and encourage sharing across departments.
Protect sensitive data while enabling high-level insights.
Increase cross-functional collaboration between IT, data governance, legal, and operations.
AI Governance & Safe Adoption
Clear policies defining approved AI tools, data upload rules, and IT vetting requirements.
Human review required for AI outputs.
AI used intentionally for innovation, not informally or haphazardly.
Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Intelligence
Cross-department data layer to identify resident-level activities.
Highlight gaps in care or support.
Enable cross-marketing and cross-service efforts.
Unified understanding of each resident across medical, housing, and services.
4. Additional Observations
No direct pain points in philanthropy, but upstream problems stem from disconnected systems.
Legal oversight of 1,100 entities creates significant data/document management burdens.
A central project log would support compliance, transparency, and coordination.
Data integration is as much a cultural challenge (information hoarding) as a technical one.
NCR lags behind peers in collaboration and data-sharing sophistication.
5. Summary Insight
Julie’s perspective highlights NCR’s foundational challenge: system fragmentation and data isolation. Manual processes, inconsistent data governance, and a culture of information protection hinder efficiency and compliance.
The future state requires:
A unified data backbone
Automated workflows
Standardized AI governance
A centralized legal/corporate entity system
Cross-functional collaboration aligned with Mark Miller’s data-link strategy
Her vision supports building an enterprise-wide intelligence layer that integrates legal, clinical, housing, volunteer, and donor ecosystems while upholding HIPAA and regulatory protections.
