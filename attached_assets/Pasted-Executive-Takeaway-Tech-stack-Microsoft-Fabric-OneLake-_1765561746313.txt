🚫 Redundancies Removed
Multiple donor letter engines → Consolidated into Document Agent + Donor/Volunteer modules.
Standalone predictive dashboards → Embedded into Power BI role-based dashboards.
Duplicate volunteer tools (SignUpGenius, homegrown) → Replaced by Volunteer & Engagement Hub.
Mango Apps intranet → Migrated to SharePoint.
Legacy custom apps (3–5) → Retired or rebuilt in Power Apps.
Excel-driven reporting → Replaced by Fabric datasets + Power BI certified reports.




Agent Strategy
1. Core Agent Types
CareGuide Agent: Conversational intake assistant for families; validates coordinator entries; generates outcome metrics.
Compliance Agent: Automates HUD/CMS filings, assembles evidence, enforces HIPAA/PII rules.
Document Agent: Drafts donor letters, grant narratives, board reports, and audit bundles.
Engagement Agent: Prioritizes donors, volunteers, and funders; prevents cannibalization; schedules outreach.
Financial Agent: Consolidates P&L, detects double counting, forecasts cash flow, tracks donor acquisition costs.
Orchestration Agent: Coordinates tasks across modules, enforces SLAs, escalates anomalies.
Training Agent: Provides contextual help, micro-learning, and adoption nudges inside workflows.
2. Agent Operating Principles
Embedded in modules: Each agent lives inside its relevant app hub (e.g., CareGuide Agent inside CareGuide 2.0).
Human-in-the-loop: Sensitive actions (filings, donor comms, merges) require staff approval.
Audit trails: Every agent action logged for compliance and trust.
Feedback loops: Staff can correct or rate AI outputs; agents learn continuously.
Event-driven: Agents respond to triggers from Azure Event Grid (e.g., intake submitted, donor pledge logged, compliance deadline approaching).
📱 App Strategy
1. Unified App Shell
Structure: Modular web + mobile app (React/Power Platform) with hubs for CareGuide, Grants, Donor, Volunteer, Compliance, Finance, Strategy, Housing, Healthcare, Knowledge.
Role-based dashboards: Executives, fundraisers, clinicians, housing managers each see tailored “next best actions.”
Global search: Microsoft Search integration across residents, donors, grants, properties, filings, documents.
Smart notifications: Context-aware nudges (expiring certifications, donor lapses, lease renewals).
Mobile-first: Simplified frontline views (3–4 primary actions per role).
2. How the App Supports Agents
Data context: App modules provide structured data (eligibility rules, donor records, grant pipelines) that agents act on.
Workflow orchestration: App defines steps and approvals; agents automate them.
Simplified info searching: App organizes records into hubs; agents query across hubs to answer questions instantly.
User interface: App is the “face” of the agents—staff interact with dashboards, forms, and portals, while agents handle the heavy lifting behind the scenes.
