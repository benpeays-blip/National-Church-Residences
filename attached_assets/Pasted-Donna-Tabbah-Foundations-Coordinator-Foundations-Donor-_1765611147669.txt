Foundations & Donor Relations Strategy

1. Current Challenges
Volunteer Experience Difficulties
Information on company volunteer requirements must be manually gathered from websites.
Data is often incomplete or unclear, leading to frustration and wasted effort.
No centralized record of volunteer group requirements; repetitive conversations occur.
Donor Acknowledgment Challenges
Letters must be personalized to each donor’s specific giving purpose.
High volume: ~200 letters per month plus three mailings per week.
Many donors are seniors who require physical copies.
Current process is labor-intensive and not automated.
Wishlist Inefficiencies
Amazon wishlists are managed manually and are extremely time-consuming.
No centralized system for communities to manage or publish wishlists.
Data Quality & Reporting Issues
Current system usage is reactive rather than intentional.
Raiser’s Edge is underutilized due to limited training and expertise.
990 reports are sometimes incorrect due to improper categorization of in-kind donations.
Donated goods are not tracked properly, leading to compliance and reporting inaccuracies.
Donations in Raiser’s Edge and Workday must be manually reconciled due to monthly sync.
2. Current Tools & Constraints
Raiser’s Edge (Blackbaud) – Used for donor and gift management; underutilized due to limited training. Syncs manually with Workday once per month.
Workday – Accounting system of record; requires manual alignment with Raiser’s Edge data.
ChatGPT (transitioning to Microsoft Copilot) – Used personally but not fully integrated into workflows.
3. Desired Capabilities (“Wants”)
Volunteer & Corporate Partner Needs
Centralized database of company volunteer requirements.
Automatic extraction of information from websites.
Notes from prior engagements stored in a structured, searchable record.
Donor Acknowledgment Automation
Personalized, purpose-specific donor letters generated automatically.
Integration with Raiser’s Edge to tie letters directly to giving data.
Support for printing physical copies for senior donors.
Wishlist Modernization
Centralized Community Wishlist Hub where each community manages its own list.
Automatic branded public pages for each community.
Aggregated directory of wishlists for donors and corporate partners.
Tracking of purchased items, remaining needs, and corporate “adoptions.”
Integration with Amazon Charity Lists or Gooddler.
Reporting & Compliance Improvements
More rigorous tracking of in-kind donations.
Structured categories for donated goods within CRM.
Improved accuracy of 990 reporting.
System Optimization
Better training and expertise in Raiser’s Edge.
Integration of automation tools (Copilot, AI assistants).
More seamless, automated syncing between Raiser’s Edge and Workday.
4. Additional Observations
Donor lapses (e.g., annual appeal drop-offs) are not proactively tracked.
Many operational delays stem from manual tasks that could be automated.
Strong donor loyalty exists, especially among seniors who require consistent physical communication.
Volunteer strategy would benefit from an internal intelligence layer summarizing corporate interests.
5. Summary Insight
Donna’s perspective highlights manual, repetitive processes across donor acknowledgments, volunteer management, wishlist coordination, and data reporting.
The desired future state is a centralized, automated, intelligence-driven system that:
Simplifies donor communication
Tracks corporate volunteer preferences
Creates self-managed community wishlists
Ensures accurate compliance reporting
Uses Raiser’s Edge and Workday proactively instead of reactively
The opportunity is to replace fragmented workflows with a unified operational and donor-relationship intelligence platform.
