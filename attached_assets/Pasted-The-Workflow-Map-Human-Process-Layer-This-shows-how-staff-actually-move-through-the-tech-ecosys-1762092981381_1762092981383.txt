The Workflow Map (Human + Process Layer)

This shows how staff actually move through the tech ecosystem during the donor cycle.
It highlights who does what, in what sequence, and where data flows back.

You can create 4–6 swim lanes:

Development Officer / Gift Officer

Prospect Researcher

Marketing / Communications

Grants Team

Finance

Executive Leadership / Reporting

Typical Fundraising Workflow (Example Sequence)
Stage 1 – Prospect Identification

Prospect Researcher logs into Salesforce → pulls donor data.

Cross-references names in WealthEngine/iWave → exports wealth scores.

Adds capacity ratings and notes back into Salesforce.

Alerts Development Officer to high-value prospects via email or Teams.

Stage 2 – Outreach & Cultivation

Development Officer reviews prospect record in Salesforce.

Sends personalized email through Outlook/Mailchimp using CRM data.

Schedules introductory meeting; logs activity in Salesforce.

After meeting, updates notes and stage (“Cultivation” → “Solicitation”).

Stage 3 – Proposal or Ask

Officer collaborates with Grants Team or Program Staff to draft proposal in Word/SharePoint.

Uses previous funder data and impact metrics from Power BI.

Final proposal sent; record updated in Salesforce with expected ask amount.

Stage 4 – Gift Processing

Donor commits gift → info entered into Salesforce, synced with Financial Edge.

Finance Team reconciles transaction and issues acknowledgment.

Marketing/Comms triggers automated thank-you email via Mailchimp.

Stage 5 – Stewardship

Program Staff upload impact stories and photos to SharePoint.

Development Officer pulls updates for personalized follow-up letter or event invitation.

Power BI Dashboard aggregates donor engagement and gift trends for quarterly reporting.

🧠 C. Typical Workflow Variations by Team
1. Major Gifts Team

Works mainly in Salesforce and WealthEngine.

Relies on Executive Assistant or Database Manager for record updates.

Uses Outlook for personal communications, rarely logs full correspondence.

Often double-enters contact notes → opportunity for automation.

2. Grants Team

Works in Word/Excel, Foundant, and SharePoint.

Tracks deadlines manually; reporting is time-consuming.

Limited integration with donor CRM → no unified funder profile.

3. Marketing / Communications

Runs Mailchimp campaigns with outdated segmentation lists exported from Salesforce.

Measures success only via open/click rates, not donor conversions.

Event invitation and post-event follow-up disconnected from CRM.

4. Finance / Accounting

Receives batch reports from Salesforce for reconciliation.

Enters data manually into Financial Edge.

Gift coding errors cause periodic reporting mismatches.

5. Executive Leadership

Gets quarterly reports from Power BI or manually assembled Excel summaries.

Lacks real-time visibility into pipeline, proposals, and campaign performance.

🚀 D. What to Include in Your Visual Tech + Workflow Map

When you build this in Google Slides, aim for two connected diagrams:

1. Tech Ecosystem Map (Static System View)

3–4 tiers of systems by function (as above).

Each product represented by its logo.

Arrows showing data movement (manual vs automated flows).

Label color code:

Blue = Core CRM

Gray = Operations

Green = Engagement

Gold = Intelligence / AI Integration (Your layer)

2. Workflow Map (Dynamic Human Process View)

Use swim lanes or flow chart style.

Each box = step in donor lifecycle (Prospect → Cultivate → Solicit → Steward).

Each icon = the software used at that step.

Add small labels for who owns each step (Officer, Research, Marketing, etc.).

Highlight pain points with ⚠️ icons (manual steps, disconnected data).

End with “AI Opportunity” callouts (automation, integration, insight).
