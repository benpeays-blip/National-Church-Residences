1. THE ACQUAINTANCE (LOW ENERGY, LOW STRUCTURE)
“Loosely known, lightly engaged, no emotional bond, and no clear pathway.”
Definition

Acquaintances are donors who:

Respond to general appeals (direct mail, email blasts, digital ads).

Have minimal relationship history with the organization.

Have given once or a few times but without ongoing personal engagement.

Are not yet relationally “seen.”

Often don’t remember giving or can’t articulate the mission clearly.

Characteristics

Transactional giving.

Motivated by broad causes, not relationships.

No expectation of reciprocation.

Low brand loyalty.

Easily lost if communication lapses.

Psychology

Acquaintances give out of:

impulse,

low-level curiosity,

“someone asked me and it sounded good,”

or social conformity (everyone gives to something).

The relationship is shallow because no intentional structure OR personal energy exists.

Risks

High churn.

Forgotten donors.

Donor fatigue quickly.

No memory of your organization among their giving priorities.

2. THE FRIEND (HIGH ENERGY, LOW STRUCTURE)
“Deep affection, high relational warmth, but no organized path to partnership.”
Definition

Friends are donors who:

Know you personally (staff, volunteers, neighbors, church members).

Like what you do, and like YOU.

Say things like, “Let me know how I can help,” but no plan emerges.

Willing to give time or emotional encouragement.

Often inconsistent givers because no structure nudges them forward.

Characteristics

High relational capital.

Motivated by affinity, story, and people.

Warm, but unpredictable.

Relationship = personal, not institutional.

Psychology

Friends give because:

They trust the person more than the organization.

They feel emotional resonance.

They feel loyalty to a leader or founder.

But without structure:

They never fully integrate.

They rarely become large or sustained givers.

They remain “friendly, but uncommitted.”

Risks

Relational drift if contact is inconsistent.

Emotional energy spent without strategic progression.

Can stay “stuck” in friendliness without movement.

3. THE COLLEAGUE (LOW ENERGY, HIGH STRUCTURE)
“Predictable, routine, system-driven, but not emotionally invested.”
Definition

Colleagues are:

Auto-pay donors.

Monthly small givers.

Workplace donors.

Event attendees who give because “this is what we do every year.”

People who respond well to structured programs but not personal connection.

Characteristics

Stable but not passionate.

Consistent but not relational.

Follow process; don’t require high-touch work.

They give because the system prompts them, not because the mission grips them.

Psychology

Colleagues value:

convenience,

predictability,

minimal emotional demand,

professionalism and clarity.

They may not feel strongly connected, but they do trust your structure.

Risks

They don’t grow their giving.

They rarely advocate or influence others.

They will leave quietly if structure breaks down.

4. THE PARTNER (HIGH ENERGY, HIGH STRUCTURE)
“Aligned, invested, relationally connected, and strategically engaged.”
Definition

Partners are:

Multi-year givers.

Multi-digit donors (major gift level).

People who see themselves as part of the mission.

Investors, not simply donors.

Characteristics

Deep personal connection.

Clear strategic alignment.

Participates in planning, not simply funding.

Regular rhythm of communication.

Eager for updates, impact conversations, shared vision moments.

Psychology

Partners are motivated by:

belonging,

shared ownership,

transformational impact,

purpose,

stewardship.

They want:

visibility into what matters,

relational access,

clear next steps,

meaningful engagement.

Risks

High expectation for transparency.

Relationship must be tended like a garden.

Requires both relational energy AND organizational excellence.
