Jake Swint
VP Strategic Growth and Operations Support
Strategy and Operations Support  
(Strategy & Operations Support; healthcare operations, billing, patient engagement, talent acquisition)
1. Current Challenges
Manual Processes
Intake decisions rely on judgment calls rather than standardized workflows.
Heavy reliance on paper, fax, and printed documents.
Batch file transfers and manual audits slow down operations.
Billing & Outsourcing Costs
NCR pays around $1M annually to home health and hospice vendors for billing.
Outsourcing costs approach $1M, not including in‑house expenses.
Talent Acquisition & Occupancy
Recruitment pipeline is slow, delaying onboarding of critical staff.
Occupancy issue: demand exists, but response times to inquiries are days or weeks instead of hours.
Accounts Payable Inefficiency
AP relies on physical check printing.
Hundreds of checks are mailed manually, creating inefficiency and risk.

2. Current Tech Stack
Primarily paper‑based and manual systems.
Fax machines, batch file transfers, and check printers dominate workflows.
Limited automation or integration with modern platforms.

3. Desired Capabilities (“Wants”)
Visibility & Process Mapping
Full transparency into intake workflows.
Map data and processes to identify inefficiencies.
Deploy intelligent agents to represent entire departments and interact across functions.
Automation & Scheduling
Automated scheduling for clinicians to reduce manual coordination.
Streamlined intake decisions supported by AI agents rather than human judgment alone.
Patient Engagement
Improved communication and faster response times.
Digital tools to enhance patient experience and reduce delays.

4. Notes & Strategic Context
Current operations are fragmented and inefficient, with high reliance on manual processes and outsourcing.
Billing and AP represent immediate opportunities for automation and cost savings.
Occupancy challenges stem from slow response times, not lack of demand — highlighting the need for patient engagement tools.
Jake’s vision emphasizes visibility, automation, and intelligent agents as the foundation for operational transformation.

5. Summary Insight
Jake’s perspective highlights manual processes, outsourcing costs, and slow response times as core barriers to operational efficiency. NCR’s current reliance on paper, fax, and physical checks creates unnecessary expense and risk.
The desired future state requires:
Tremendous visibility into workflows and data to identify inefficiencies.
Intelligent agents deployed to streamline intake and cross‑departmental interactions.
Automated scheduling for clinicians to reduce manual burden.
Improved patient engagement tools to accelerate response times and enhance experience.
Jake’s role is to drive operational modernization, reducing costs, improving efficiency, and positioning NCR to deliver faster, more reliable services while building a scalable operations support model.
