Event Manager (Contractor) – 1. Current Challenges
Information Management & Workflow Inefficiency
80% of the job is manually tracking people and information.
Reliance on multiple spreadsheets and disconnected documents.
Tracking is repetitive, error‑prone, and inefficient.
Invitations and registration processes are not tied to any centralized system or data source.
Communications across teams are weaker than they should be.
Organizational Visibility & Structure Issues
No unified place to view organizational structure, roles, and functions.
Staff “live in a vacuum” instead of sharing information and working as a community.
Lack of a centralized knowledge hub to understand responsibilities and internal capabilities.
Event Management Limitations (Golf Event + National Conference)
Golf event registration and reporting are entirely manual.
Sponsorship pricing is under‑optimized ($10,000 per foursome considered underpriced).
Sponsorship tiers do not drive competition or maximize revenue.
Foursomes often sell out before higher sponsorship tiers are reached.
No visibility into who is actually in each foursome — only the purchaser is known.
Vendors lack structured competition or value‑driven placement, despite 200–300 participants.
Invitations and registration systems are disconnected from donor or vendor profiles.
Strategic Alignment & Fundraising Culture
Incentives are not tied to organizational goals.
No framework to guide pricing or sponsorship tiers.
Brand alignment opportunities are underutilized.
Current approach limits fundraising potential, awareness, culture‑building, and stewardship cycles.

2. Current Tools & Constraints
Adobe Suite — used for branding and design.
No dedicated event management system for golf events or national conference.
GolfStatus (recommended, not used) — would automate golf registration, foursome tracking, sponsorship tiers, digital scoring, and team data.
Mission Central (concept awareness) — referenced as an example of a structured nonprofit logistics system.
Overall: heavy reliance on manual tools; little integration across systems.

3. Desired Capabilities (“Wants”)
Golf Event Modernization
Streamlined, automated golf registration and management system.
Centralized registration for players, sponsors, vendors, and foursomes.
Automated tracking of sponsorship purchasers, actual players, and vendor booth assignments.
Tiered sponsorship levels with pricing that drives competition.
Ability to sell higher‑priced sponsorships before foursomes sell out.
Vendor competition for premium placement.
Integration with donor CRM to tie invitations and vendor communications to historical giving or sponsorship data.
Reporting dashboards for registrations, revenue forecasting, vendor/sponsor performance, and event status.
Organizational Knowledge Hub
Centralized, searchable space showing org chart, department functions, staff responsibilities, and contact information.
Tool to reduce the “vacuum” effect and increase cross‑team collaboration.
Improved Communication & Data Use
Communications tied to centralized data, not individual spreadsheets.
Automated updates for vendors, sponsors, and participants.
Better cross‑team coordination for events and fundraising.

4. Notes & Strategic Context
Coordinates NCR’s major annual golf event and national conference.
Oversees branding for the organization.
Works with 200–300 vendors, seeing untapped value in brand alignment, sponsor visibility, competitive pricing, and nonprofit‑partner positioning.
Believes NCR’s brand value increases when vendors associate with a high‑impact nonprofit.
Identifies four pillars NCR must strengthen: fundraising, awareness, culture, stewardship.

5. Summary Insight
Chel’s perspective highlights manual tracking, weak communication, and under‑optimized sponsorship structures as barriers to effective event management.
The desired future state requires:
A modern, automated event‑management platform.
Strategic sponsorship structures that maximize competition and revenue.
Clear org‑wide visibility through a centralized knowledge hub.
Unified communications tied to a shared data source.
Chel’s role is to modernize NCR’s event management, ensuring flagship events like golf tournaments and the national conference are efficient, financially transparent, and strategically aligned with organizational goals.

Would you like me to now merge Chel’s profile into the consolidated leadership document alongside Jake, Sonya, and Adam so you have one unified, board‑ready package?
