Briana Mettlet
SVP of Senior Living Facilities
Health Services & Senior Living Strategy

1. Current Challenges
Information Requests & Visibility
Constant demand for stories, statistics, and analysis from external stakeholders.
Limited ability to package and present data in a compelling, donor-facing way.
Operational Inefficiencies
Back-office intake for home health is tedious: 4 staff manually process insurance documents and Medicare Advantage plans.
Manual reporting of capital expenses for each property.
Employment and agency billing systems not standardized; need urgent setup in Workday.
Data & Reporting Gaps
Relies on daily census report (Dapper report) for occupancy.
Monday morning report tracks incoming funds, restrictions, and project notes, but lacks automation.
No streamlined way to thank donors or view gifts tied to projects.
Philanthropy & Program Development
Hospice identified as a major area for philanthropic growth.
Wellness programs are a huge opportunity since insurance does not cover them.
Senior living philanthropy is harder to position because residents may already have funds.
Collaboration Issues
Need stronger collaboration between Karla and Briana to align housing, healthcare, and services.
Disconnect between senior services and senior living operations.
2. Current Tools & Constraints
Athena – Clinical system.
Power BI – Reporting tool; data rolls up to Workday.
Workday – Financial and operational backbone under Mark Miller.
Thrivent X – Grades resident satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and polity.
Dax Copilot – Needed for efficiency in intake and reporting.
Manual Reports – Used for capital expenses and occupancy tracking.
3. Desired Capabilities (“Wants”)
System Integration & Automation
Intake and agency billing processes automated in Workday.
Capital expense tracking streamlined in Workday.
Automated donor acknowledgment tied to financial and project data.
Data & Analytics
Enhanced Power BI dashboards for occupancy, financials, and satisfaction metrics.
Unified reporting across housing, healthcare, and senior living.
Ability to share revenue insights back across divisions.
Philanthropy & Storytelling
Clear narrative combining housing, program support, healthcare, home health, assisted living, and rehab.
Storytelling framework to raise funds by showing holistic impact.
Position hospice and wellness programs as philanthropic priorities.
Collaboration & Alignment
Better coordination between Karla and Briana to unify housing and healthcare strategies.
Integration of senior services and senior living, with senior care layered on top.
4. Additional Observations
Briana has 20 years of experience in senior services and leads senior living operations.
NCR is the largest nonprofit provider of affordable housing in the nation, and the largest in central Ohio for senior housing.
Shawn Shields (new hire) will handle parent financials.
Data analytics team leads Thrivent X and reporting initiatives.
Affordable housing philanthropy is easier to position; senior living requires more nuanced messaging.
5. Summary Insight
Briana’s perspective highlights operational inefficiencies, fragmented reporting, and untapped philanthropic opportunities in hospice and wellness.
The desired future state requires:
Automated intake, billing, and capital expense tracking in Workday
Unified reporting through Power BI and Workday integration
A compelling narrative that combines housing, healthcare, and senior living into one holistic story
Stronger collaboration between housing and healthcare leadership
This positions NCR to leverage its scale as the nation’s largest affordable housing provider while expanding philanthropy in hospice, wellness, and integrated senior care.
