Feature: Quadrant “Playbooks” Embedded in the Page

You already defined good theology behind each quadrant. Turn that into codified playbooks.

For each quadrant you click:

Show:

Definition (what this type of donor looks like)

Core risks (what happens if we do nothing)

1–3 movement pathways (short sequences of steps)

Example for Friend → Partner:

Pathway A:

Schedule 1:1 vision conversation

Share 2–3 specific partnership options

Follow up in 7 days with clear ask

Pathway B (for busy people):

Invite to small, curated dinner

Share 12–18 month vision

Propose becoming a “lead partner” on one project

On the page, you can pair these pathways with buttons:

“Apply Pathway A” → opens wizard filtered to Friends fitting that pattern.

“Show Donors Ready for Pathway B” → filters the top 10 list.

5. Feature: Movement Alerts & “Recent Shifts”

To make this feel alive, show what’s changing:

“New to Friend” – donors who just showed high energy (event attendance, notes, replies).

“New to Colleague” – signed up for autopay, recurring, etc.

“At Risk” – donors who were Partner/Friend/Colleague but have gone quiet for 6–12 months.

A simple panel:

4 tiles, one for each quadrant, with:

Count

Net change since last 30 days

“View changes” link to see who moved.

This tells the team:

Who is warming up (to pursue).

Who is cooling down (to rescue).

6. Feature: “Time Budget to Action Plan” Connector

One of the most useful things you can do:

Let a director enter:

“This week our team has 4 lunch slots, 8 call slots, 20 personalized-email slots.”

The system uses that to auto-generate a schedule:

Example output:

Lunches (4)

Evelyn – Friend → Partner

Brandon – Colleague → Partner

Couple in Dallas – high-capacity Friends

New prospect introduced by board member

Calls (8)
Names and scripts.

Emails (20)
List of colleagues and acquaintances to warm up with specific templates.

Now the dev team doesn’t just see data; they see this week’s marching orders.

7. Feature: Integrated Notes and “Spiritual / Relational Context”

Because your world is Christian, you might want a layer beyond pure CRM fields:

For each donor card (when clicked from the quadrant), show:

Relational history summary.

Spiritual context (e.g., where they’re at spiritually or in understanding the mission).

“Prayer focus” (what staff are praying for regarding that donor).

Last “non-ask” touch (encouragement, Scripture shared, hospitality, etc.).

This reinforces that donors are people, not just revenue sources, while still being highly strategic.

8. Feature: Scenario & Impact Simulation (Optional, but Powerful)

This is more advanced, but it makes the quadrant feel like a strategic tool:

“If we successfully move:

3 of the top 10 Friends to Partner at average gift X;

and 4 of the top 20 Colleagues to Partner at average upgrade Y;
what would that do to our 12-month forecast?”

The tool could show:

Estimated increase in annual giving.

Influence effects (e.g., if a Partner typically brings 1–2 new major leads).

This helps leadership see why time with certain people is worth more than time with others.
