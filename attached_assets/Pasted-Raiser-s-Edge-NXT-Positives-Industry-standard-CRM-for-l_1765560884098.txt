Raiser’s Edge NXT – Positives
Industry-standard CRM for large and established nonprofits


Handles complex donor records extremely well (pledges, soft credits, tributes, planned giving)


Large ecosystem: consultants, integrations, and RE-trained fundraisers readily available


Long-term stability and trusted by boards/executives


Strong native integration with WealthEngine


Solid for traditional major-gifts recordkeeping and stewardship



Raiser’s Edge NXT – Negatives
Outdated user experience; slow, clunky, and not intuitive for frontline fundraisers


Weak reporting and analytics; often requires exports to Excel/PowerBI/Tableau


Does not unify data across systems (no connection to Yardi, RealPage, program data, finance, etc.)


Limited AI capabilities; not built for automation, insights, or modern workflows


High cost relative to features; add-ons and customizations drive cost up


Difficult to customize or adapt to organizational processes


Low adoption by frontline fundraisers, resulting in low ROI
DonorSearch
Why They Have DonorSearch but Don’t Use It
It was bundled or added years ago and never fully rolled out to staff.


No one was trained on how to interpret or apply DonorSearch scores.


Fundraisers often feel the data is “too noisy” or produces false positives, so they stop trusting it.


WealthEngine is already integrated into Raiser’s Edge, making it the easier tool to access—so DonorSearch becomes redundant.


DonorSearch requires manual searching, while staff prefer not to switch systems or open extra tabs.


Leadership didn’t champion adoption, so it never became part of the culture.


Capacity constraints—teams are overwhelmed and stick with familiar tools rather than learning a second prospecting system.


Fundraisers believe DonorSearch inflates capacity estimates, so they ignore it.


No workflows or SOPs were built around using DonorSearch for portfolio management.


The organization has historically been grant-centric, not major-gift-centric, so the tool’s value wasn’t obvious.


DonorSearch requires clean data for best results, and many orgs don’t have that, leading to mistrust.


The UI is less intuitive than WealthEngine’s inside-RE experience.


It was purchased with the belief that “we should have a screening tool,” but no strategic owner kept it alive.



Here is a clean, balanced, high-level summary of the real-world positives and negatives of DonorSearch, written for executive decision-makers.

DonorSearch – Positives
Excellent philanthropic giving data

 Strong at identifying past charitable giving, foundation board ties, and donor generosity patterns.


Better for faith-based donors than WealthEngine

 Includes church giving when publicly available and picks up patterns helpful for Christian organizations.


Strong affinity/propensity scoring

 Helps identify donors likely to give to specific causes or types of missions.


Robust screening reports

 Good for batch screenings, major gift prospecting, and uncovering hidden mid-level donors.


Integrates with major CRMs

 Works with Raiser’s Edge, Salesforce, DonorPerfect, Neon, etc.


Useful for foundation prospecting

 Can surface charitable trusts, donor-advised fund histories, and family foundation board members.


Good customer support

 Generally responsive and offers onboarding help.



DonorSearch – Negatives
Higher rate of “false positives”

 Many nonprofits say it flags donors as wealthy who aren’t—leading to research fatigue and mistrust.


Not naturally embedded in Raiser’s Edge workflows

 Staff must switch systems or open separate tools, which hurts adoption.


More manual than WealthEngine

 Requires extra steps to validate results or drill down into data.


Interface is clunky compared to modern tools

 The UI feels dated and harder to navigate, especially for frontline fundraisers.


Capacity scores can be inflated

 Some organizations stop trusting DS ratings because the wealth estimates feel overly generous.


Doesn’t meaningfully unify data

 Still just a lookup tool—not a holistic intelligence layer.


Underused without a champion

 Many nonprofits buy DonorSearch but never integrate it into daily portfolio or pipeline processes.


Staff often lack training to interpret results

 Without clear SOPs, fundraisers don’t know how to apply the ratings correctly.


Not optimized for real-time automation or AI

 Data is static; it doesn’t generate next-best actions or relationship intelligence without another platform (like Futuria) sitting on top.


Summary in One Sentence
DonorSearch is a powerful donor discovery and philanthropic-giving database, but it is often underutilized because its results can feel noisy, its UI is dated, and it requires training and intentional workflow design to use effectively.

Power BI is Microsoft’s data analytics and dashboard tool.
It turns raw data into interactive charts, dashboards, and reports that leaders can use to make decisions.
Here’s the simple breakdown:

What Power BI Is
A business intelligence and reporting platform


Used to visualize data, track KPIs, and build dashboards


Connects to almost any data source: Excel, SQL, Salesforce, Raiser’s Edge, Yardi, etc.


Cloud-based, desktop-based, or embedded inside apps


Think of it as Excel + dashboards + automation + live data connections.

What Power BI Is Used For
Executive dashboards


Financial reporting


Donor pipeline dashboards


Grant performance tracking


Operational metrics


Compliance benchmarks


Housing occupancy data


Revenue and expense analysis


Board reporting


National Church Residences definitely uses it or would benefit from it—especially because RE NXT reporting is weak.

Power BI – Key Strengths
Connects to dozens of systems (Excel, SQL, APIs, etc.)


Creates real-time dashboards for leadership


Much more powerful than Excel for complex data


Customizable visualizations


Can automate recurring reporting


Works well with Microsoft environments (Teams, SharePoint, Azure)


Excellent for slicing, filtering, and drilling into data



Power BI – Weaknesses
Requires technical skill to set up


Can get complicated when many data sources are involved


Needs clean data—messy data produces messy dashboards


Hard for non-technical staff to build advanced reports


Still requires Excel for some prep work


Not a fundraising system—just a visualization tool



Summary
Power BI is Microsoft’s analytics and dashboard tool. It pulls data from multiple systems, visualizes it clearly, and automates reporting. It’s powerful, but requires technical expertise to build and maintain.




PointClickCare

PointClickCare is one of the leading EHR (Electronic Health Record) and care-coordination platforms for senior living, long-term care, skilled nursing, assisted living, and home health.


Instrumentl (often misspelled as “Instrumental”) is a grant-finding and grant-management software platform widely used by nonprofits, foundations, and fundraising teams.
It is one of the fastest-growing tools in the grant world.
Here’s the clean breakdown:

What Instrumentl Is
A cloud-based system that helps nonprofits:
Find new grants (federal, state, local, corporate, and foundation)


Track deadlines and submissions


Manage active grants in a centralized dashboard


Store documents and reporting requirements


Automate reminders


Collaborate across teams


It’s basically a grant discovery + CRM + workflow tracker for grant teams.

Positives of Instrumentl
Excellent grant discovery engine

 Pulls from federal, state, county, local, and private funders—far better organized than Grants.gov or Foundation Directory alone.


Automatic matching

 Suggests grants based on your organization’s mission and history.


Very clean, modern user interface

 Easier to use than older tools.


Centralized grant pipeline

 Keeps discovery → applications → awards all in one place.


Automated reminders and deadline tracking

 Prevents missed opportunities.


Great for small and mid-sized teams

 Reduces manual spreadsheets and email chaos.


Good collaboration tools

 Team notes, shared workspaces, document uploads.


Affordable compared to many enterprise systems

 Lower cost than Blackbaud’s grant tools or Fluxx.


Strong customer support & training

 Known for helpful onboarding and webinars.



Negatives of Instrumentl
Not a full enterprise grants system

 Good for discovery and workflow but not a full compliance system like eCivis or SmartSimple.


Limited reporting capabilities

 Not as deep as Power BI, Salesforce, or Foundry.


Weak integration with large CRMs

 Limited native integrations with Raiser’s Edge or Salesforce without middleware.


Not built for federal-heavy compliance

 If your org relies heavily on HUD, CMS, or HHS grants, you still need separate compliance systems.


Not ideal for massive organizations

 Larger nonprofits sometimes outgrow it.


Still requires manual input

 It organizes grants but doesn’t write them or automate complex workflows.


Designed primarily for grant fundraising, not grant administration

 It is discovery-first, not compliance-first.



Summary
Instrumentl is a modern, user-friendly platform that helps nonprofits find and manage grants more efficiently. It’s excellent for discovery, organization, and team collaboration—but it’s not a full compliance system, lacks deep CRM integrations, and isn’t as powerful for large organizations with complex federal grants.

Here is the clear, honest, executive-level answer:
Instrumentl is the best grant discovery and lightweight tracking tool for small–mid sized nonprofits, but it is not the best tool for large, complex organizations with heavy federal and HUD compliance—like National Church Residences.
Let’s break that down simply.

Where Instrumentl IS the Best
Instrumentl is arguably #1 in these categories:
Grant discovery (best search engine for foundations + state/local grants)


Ease of use (very simple, clean UI)


Small-to-mid-sized nonprofit workflow management


Affordable grant-finding tool


Modern, searchable database for private foundations


Automated deadline reminders


Centralized pipeline for a small team


If your grant work is mostly philanthropic foundations, Instrumentl is probably the best modern tool.

Where Instrumentl Is NOT the Best
Large organizations with complex federal grants (HUD, CMS, HHS, state agencies) need features Instrumentl does not provide.
Instrumentl is not the best for:
Federal grant compliance


Post-award grant management


Complex reporting requirements (HUD, LIHTC, Medicare/Medicaid, state agencies)


Budgeting, match tracking, subrecipient monitoring


Audit trails or OMB Uniform Guidance needs


Integrating with enterprise systems (Yardi, Workday, finance systems)


High-volume government grant portfolios


For this level of complexity, the best tools are systems like:
SmartSimple


eCivis


Fluxx


Blackbaud Grantmaking (the enterprise product, not RE NXT)


These are expensive, but they handle federal requirements—Instrumentl does not.

So, is Instrumentl the best for National Church Residences?
No—not for their full portfolio.
NCR has:
HUD grants


state & federal funding


compliance-heavy reporting


large operational complexity


cross-functional finance requirements


Instrumentl cannot meet that enterprise need.
But it could be a great supplement for finding philanthropic or local grants.

Simple Summary
Instrumentl is the best modern tool for finding and organizing philanthropic grants.
It is not the best tool for managing large, federal, compliance-heavy grants for a national housing & senior-care organization.
