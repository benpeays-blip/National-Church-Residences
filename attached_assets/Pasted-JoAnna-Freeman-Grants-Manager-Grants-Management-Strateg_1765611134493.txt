Grants Management Strategy
1. Current Challenges
Fragmented Information
Reliance on anecdotal stories; no structured process to collect impact narratives.
Old grants stored only in Excel and paper files, making reporting slow and error-prone.
No unified visibility across teams—Marketing, Foundation, Affordable Housing, Development, and Services often contact the same external organizations without coordination.
System & Workflow Inefficiency
Workday does not integrate with Instrumentl; data must be exported to CSV and manually uploaded.
Workday is cumbersome, requiring extensive navigation and long page reads.
Grant management involves excessive manual work (narratives, reporting, purchase requests, receipt uploads).
Grantees email reports with no structured system; tracking is manual and scattered.
Outstanding invoices and credit card transactions do not appear on Workday gift tags, creating inaccurate financial visibility.
Lack of Insight & Reporting
No dashboard to view overall grant pipeline, submission progress, approvals vs. denials, or individual grant status.
Cannot easily track grant expenses or see available balances.
Limited ability to research organizations efficiently due to lack of integrated tools and time constraints.
Relationship & Fundraising Conflicts
Cannibalization: multiple staff unknowingly ask the same funder for support.
Different divisions pursue fundraising independently, creating a confusing external message.
No central system showing who has contacted whom, when, and for what purpose.
Informal approaches (e.g., lunches, gift card asks) sometimes outperform structured grant requests due to inefficiencies.
2. Current Tools & Constraints
Instrumentl – Well-liked and used since April; helps find and track grants but remains highly manual.
Workday – Holds all financial data including gift tags; poor user experience, lacks dashboards, no integration with grant systems.
GuideStar – Used for research.
Microsoft Copilot – Approved tool but not yet leveraged.
GrantHub Pro – Previously used, now inactive.
3. Desired Capabilities (“Wants”)
Grant Team Needs
Full grants dashboard showing pipeline stages, submissions, approvals/denials, life cycle progress, real-time spend vs. budgets, and outstanding expenses.
Accurate expense tracking with visibility into all affecting balances.
Easier research of potential organizations.
Relationship intelligence to identify board connections, previous giving history, and engagement “sweet spots.”
Formal, simple expense submission workflow.
Structured, automated narrative and compliance reporting.
Automated emails and reminders tied to reporting deadlines.
Grantee Portal Requirements
Grantees log in to view grant terms, conditions, and remaining balance.
Guided expense submission with receipt uploads.
Structured reporting questionnaires.
Automated reminders and deadline visibility.
Organizational Alignment Needs
One shared system showing who is talking to which external organization, when, and for what purpose.
Centralized view across grants, individual donors, government grants, HUD funding, and property-specific requests.
Monday-style pipeline dashboard (similar to what another department already sends weekly).
4. Additional Observations
Expensing for grants is intertwined with Workday’s financial workflows, creating friction.
Purchases for grant-related items (e.g., Christmas gifts) require manual processing.
Weekly Workday gift tag reports do not reflect true available funds because unpaid items are invisible.
Significant opportunity exists to centralize and modernize grant operations.
5. Summary Insight
JoAnna’s perspective highlights a fragmented ecosystem where systems don’t talk to each other, teams lack visibility, and grant-related work is manual, repetitive, and error-prone.
The desired future state is an integrated, automated, relationship-aware grants command center that:
Streamlines financial tracking and reporting
Provides structured grantee interactions through a portal
Centralizes organizational visibility to avoid duplication and conflicts
Enables proactive, intelligence-driven grant management
