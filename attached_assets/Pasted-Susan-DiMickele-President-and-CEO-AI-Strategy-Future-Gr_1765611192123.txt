AI Strategy & Future Growth
1. Current Challenges
Housing Qualification Confusion
Older adults and families don’t know what type of housing they qualify for.
Data Inefficiency
Information is anecdotal, voluntary, and stored in an outdated CareGuide.
Service coordinators input data manually, often with errors.
NCR relies on industry data but lacks NCR-specific resident data.
Workflow Inefficiencies
Processes for research, assembling documents, and daily coordination are not streamlined.
2. Opportunities with AI
Data Modernization
Automate data retrieval and replace antiquated CareGuide with an AI-powered platform.
Capture NCR-specific resident data to measure outcomes.
Family Guidance
Provide a comprehensive, trusted guide tailored to NCR housing qualifications.
Workflow Automation
Streamline processes for research, documentation, and daily task management.
Deliver personalized daily action items to service coordinators.
Outcome Tracking
Measure health improvements, depression reduction, and loneliness metrics (via chaplaincy care line).
Communicate improvements clearly: “NCR improves in X ways by doing X.”
Mindset Shift
Position AI as a tool to free people up, not replace them.
3. Strategic Goals
Redesign CareGuide into a dynamic, AI-powered platform.
Enable outcome-driven reporting for donors and stakeholders.
Demonstrate ROI: savings, health outcomes, and quality-of-life improvements.
