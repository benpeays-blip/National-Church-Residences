Below is a “presentable” master plan that maps the **agent value map** (Data → Consumption → Agents → Personas) to **National Church Residences (NCR)** and the problem/solution matrix you provided—so leadership can see *what we automate*, *what we modernize*, *who benefits*, and *how we govern it safely*.

---

## 1) Map the agent value framework to NCR

### A. Data (the foundation NCR must unify)

These are the “atoms” agents rely on. NCR already has most of them—just fragmented.

* Company information

  * NCR entity master (1,100+ entities), programs, locations, properties, service lines
* Business activity

  * Resident events, service coordinator activity, case notes, intakes, requalifications, volunteer participation
* Financial strength

  * Workday GL, AP/AR, allocations, grants, restricted/unrestricted funds, property-level P&Ls
* Filings & events

  * HUD recerts, CMS filings, audits, board packets, incident reporting, compliance attestations
* Hierarchies

  * Org structure, property → region → division, legal entity → operating unit mappings
* Principals & contacts

  * Donors, prospects, board, vendors, grant officers, partner contacts, resident emergency contacts
* IP intelligence

  * Policies/procedures, templates, program manuals, training content, contracts
* Fraud insights

  * Payment anomalies, identity verification flags, benefits eligibility anomalies, duplicate vendor/donor records

**NCR “Data Backbone” target**

* Microsoft Fabric **OneLake** as the unified data layer
* Microsoft **Purview** for governance (classification, access policies, lineage, audit)
* Standardized “canonical objects”: Person, Resident, Donor, Gift, Grant, Property, Entity, Claim, Filing, Vendor, Volunteer, Interaction

---

### B. Consumption (how NCR users experience value)

From the diagram, these are the delivery channels. For NCR, they become a unified **App Shell + role-based hubs**:

* Platform UIs

  * NCR Unified App Shell (Donor Hub, Grants Hub, Volunteer Hub, Resident Engagement Hub, Governance Hub, Strategy Hub, Ops/Security Hub)
* Bulk data

  * Controlled exports, board packs, regulator-ready extracts, property performance snapshots
* Transactional data

  * Intake submissions, HUD recerts, billing/claims, gift acknowledgments, volunteer shifts
* AI-ready data

  * Curated feature stores for forecasting occupancy/staffing, donor propensity, compliance risk
* Marketplaces

  * Future: vetted “agent marketplace” for internal NCR teams (approved automations only)
* Agents

  * The agentic teams below, invoked from the UI and governed centrally

---

### C. Agents (NCR’s “agentic teams” catalogue)

These map directly to your matrix. Think of them as *specialized digital staff* with audit trails.

* CareGuide Agent (Healthcare + Housing)

  * Unified intake wizard, de-duplication, validation, routing across systems
* Housing Agent

  * HUD requalification workflows, document completeness checks, deadline management
* Healthcare Agent

  * Billing workflow automation, claim validation, Workday integration support
* Document Agent

  * Donor letters, impact narratives, grant narratives/reports, volunteer recognition
* Donor Agent

  * ROI dashboards, pipeline hygiene, acquisition funnel, “next best action”
* Grants Agent

  * Pipeline dashboard, dedup outreach, outcomes reporting, reporting automation
* Financial Agent

  * Consolidated reporting, double-count detection, entity-level reconciliation flags
* Compliance Agent

  * HUD/CMS filing prep, entity registry, action logging, evidence packs for audit
* Bias Monitoring Agent

  * Fairness audits for eligibility decisions + any scoring models; anomaly detection
* Strategy Agent

  * Forecasting (occupancy/staffing/finance), ROI simulations, system inventory
* Resident Engagement Agent

  * Accessibility checks, multilingual readiness, adoption prompts, digital divide workflows
* (Optional) Security Agent

  * Monitors unusual agent activity patterns + data access anomalies; ties to SIEM tooling

---

### D. Personas (who benefits / who sponsors)

Map the diagram’s personas to NCR roles so adoption is real:

* Chief Operations Officer / Ops leaders

  * Gets “system of work” visibility, staffing forecasts, operational compliance posture
* Chief Risk Officer / Compliance leadership

  * Audit trails, filing automation, Purview lineage, bias monitoring, exception handling
* Chief Compliance Officer / Legal

  * Evidence packs, policy enforcement, access governance, filing timeliness and accuracy
* Data Operations

  * OneLake pipelines, canonical objects, model monitoring, quality SLAs
* Finance leadership

  * Consolidated P&L, entity registry accuracy, close acceleration, anomaly detection
* Development leadership (donors/grants/volunteers)

  * Pipeline clarity, dedup outreach, rapid reporting, donor confidence through metrics
* Program leadership (housing/healthcare/resident services)

  * Less paperwork, fewer reworks, more time with residents/patients

---

## 2) NCR “Master Plan” (what we present)

### North Star (simple statement)

Build a **governed NCR Data + Agent platform** where staff, donors, residents, and partners interact through one app layer—while **Purview enforces privacy, auditability, and accountability**.

---

## 3) Phased roadmap (realistic, defensible, high-ROI)

### Phase 0 — Guardrails first (30–45 days)

Goal: enable agents without creating risk.

* Purview foundations

  * Data classification (HIPAA/PII/financial), access policies, lineage turned on
* Agent governance

  * “Allowed actions” registry, human-in-the-loop approvals, retention rules, logging standard
* Template & policy library

  * Approved donor letter templates, grant report templates, filing templates, tone/branding rules
* Success metrics baseline

  * Current cycle times (HUD recerts, donor acknowledgments, month close), error rates, audit findings

Deliverables:

* Governance & Compliance Hub (MVP): audit trail viewer + agent action log + data access rules dashboard
* “Agent Safety Standard” document NCR can show auditors

---

### Phase 1 — Quick wins that staff *feel* (60–90 days)

Goal: eliminate repetitive work and reduce compliance exposure.

* Document Agent (immediate payoff)

  * Donor letters + volunteer recognition + basic grant narratives
* Housing Agent (compliance + workload reduction)

  * HUD requalification workflow + completeness validation + resident reminders
* Financial Agent (visibility + trust)

  * Double-count detection flags + entity reconciliation dashboard (not full close automation yet)

Deliverables:

* Donor letters auto-generated within hours (not weeks)
* HUD recert “workflow in a box” (tasks, deadlines, validations)
* Finance transparency pilot: consolidated view for a subset of entities/properties

---

### Phase 2 — Unified intake + measurable impact (90–180 days)

Goal: unify resident/patient “front door” and tie outcomes to funding.

* CareGuide 2.0 (unified intake wizard)

  * Capture once → validate → distribute to downstream systems
* Donor impact narratives from outcomes

  * Narrative + metrics: what changed, how many served, what improved
* Grants Workspace (pipeline + reporting)

  * Dedup outreach, unified calendar, outcome reporting tied to metrics

Deliverables:

* CareGuide 2.0 intake wizard (MVP) integrated to OneLake + governed by Purview
* Donor Hub ROI dashboards (pilot) that tie gifts → programs → outcomes
* Grants Hub pipeline dashboard + report generator

---

### Phase 3 — Predictive leadership + enterprise scale (180–365 days)

Goal: leadership dashboards that drive decisions, not anecdotes.

* Strategy Agent forecasting

  * Occupancy/staffing projections, finance projections, scenario modeling
* Compliance Agent at scale

  * Filing prep automation, evidence packs, entity registry automation
* Resident Engagement Hub maturity

  * Multilingual + accessibility compliance monitoring, digital divide workflows

Deliverables:

* Predictive dashboards in Power BI (forecast overlays + scenario tools)
* Entity registry system of record (with exceptions workflow)
* Operational resilience: continuity workflows + security/ops dashboards

---

## 4) “What is handled by agents” vs “what is infrastructure”

This keeps NCR from over-automating and keeps auditors comfortable.

### Agent best-fit (repeatable, compliance-sensitive, data-driven)

* Intake routing + dedup + validation (CareGuide Agent)
* HUD requals + completeness + deadline mgmt (Housing Agent)
* Billing workflow assistance + validation (Healthcare Agent)
* Donor/grant/volunteer documents at scale (Document Agent)
* Pipeline dedup & outreach coordination (Grants Agent)
* Consolidation flags + anomaly detection (Financial Agent)
* Filing prep + evidence packs + audit trails (Compliance Agent)
* Fairness audits + anomaly monitoring (Bias Monitoring Agent)
* Forecasting + ROI simulations (Strategy Agent)

### Infrastructure / “alternative solutions” (platform and culture)

* EHR interoperability, Yardi/Workday/Raiser’s Edge integrations
* OneLake ingestion pipelines + canonical schema
* Purview governance + identity/role-based access
* SIEM, incident response, disaster recovery
* Training, champions, adoption incentives, executive sponsorship

---

## 5) NCR Unified App Shell (how the experience looks)

This is the “Consumption layer” leadership will resonate with.

* Donor Hub

  * ROI dashboards, impact narratives, acknowledgments, pipeline views
* Grants Hub

  * Pipeline, deadlines, report generator, dedup outreach, outcomes
* Volunteer Hub

  * Onboarding, scheduling, recognition automation, wishlists integration
* Resident Engagement Hub

  * Intake, service pathways, multilingual support, accessibility validation
* Governance & Compliance Hub

  * Agent audit trails, filings, Purview lineage, fairness audit reports
* Strategy & Sustainability Hub

  * Forecasts, scenario modeling, ROI simulations, sustainability metrics
* Ops & Security Hub

  * Continuity workflows, system uptime, agent observability, incident playbooks

---

## 6) “Day in the life” demo storyline (for NCR leadership)

Use this in the presentation to make it concrete.

* A resident starts an intake once in CareGuide 2.0

  * CareGuide Agent validates + routes data to the right downstream workflows
* Housing Agent launches HUD requalification steps automatically

  * Missing docs flagged; reminders sent; staff dashboard shows exceptions only
* Outcomes (services delivered) flow into OneLake with governance

  * Donor Agent generates ROI dashboard views; Document Agent generates a narrative
* Grants Agent updates a pipeline board + prevents duplicate outreach

  * Reports are produced with metrics, not anecdotes
* Compliance Agent prepares an evidence pack for filings

  * Every action logged; Purview lineage shows exactly where data came from
* Strategy Agent shows leadership a staffing/occupancy forecast

  * Leadership sees scenarios and can make staffing decisions with confidence

---

## 7) Governance: what NCR can say to auditors and regulators

Non-negotiables (these become “design constraints”):

* Human-in-the-loop for high-stakes decisions

  * Eligibility approvals, adverse actions, filings submission sign-off
* Full audit trails

  * Every agent action: who, what, when, data touched, output produced
* Purview-enforced access controls

  * HIPAA/PII boundaries; least-privilege role-based access
* Bias monitoring & fairness audits

  * Required for eligibility decisions and any scoring models
* Model risk management

  * Versioning, evaluation, drift monitoring, rollback procedures
* Data retention & redaction rules

  * Especially for health/resident data and donor privacy

---

## 8) Scorecard: how NCR measures success (board-friendly)

Pick a handful per domain:

* Housing

  * HUD recert cycle time ↓, error rate ↓, staff hours saved ↑, compliance exceptions ↓
* Healthcare

  * Claim rejection rate ↓, billing cycle time ↓, duplicate intake rate ↓
* Finance

  * Close time ↓, reconciliation exceptions ↓, entity mapping accuracy ↑
* Fundraising

  * Acknowledgment time ↓, donor retention ↑, pipeline coverage ↑, ROI reporting adoption ↑
* Grants

  * On-time submissions ↑, duplicate outreach incidents ↓, report turnaround time ↓
* Compliance & Risk

  * Audit findings ↓, filing timeliness ↑, data access violations ↓, bias flags resolved time ↓
* Adoption

  * Active users ↑, spreadsheet dependency ↓, “agent tasks completed” ↑

---

## 9) What I would put on the final 1–2 slides as the executive takeaway

* **Agents** do the repetitive, compliance-sensitive work with audit trails: intake, recerts, billing validation, letters/reports, dedup outreach, forecasting, fairness audits.
* **Platform modernization** (OneLake + Purview + Power BI + App Shell) makes those agents safe, scalable, and measurable.
* **Governance + human oversight** ensures NCR reduces risk while accelerating service delivery and donor trust.

If you want, I can turn this into a tight “board-deck outline” (10–12 slides) with:

* 1 slide: the mapped framework (Data → Consumption → Agents → Personas) in NCR language
* 1 slide: phased roadmap
* 1 slide: agent catalogue
* 1 slide: governance model
* 2 slides: domain quick wins + KPIs
* 1 slide: demo storyline / day-in-the-life
* 1 slide: investment + resourcing model (lightweight, not numbers-heavy)
